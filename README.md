# React-website-with-Cognito
This is a basic website with the basic functions of sign-up and login and different pages within React router.
The auth solution of this website is AWS Cognito, so we do not need Backend anymore for fetch TokenID,auth sign-up or even a confirmation email from AWS.
Will continue with this project since AWS offers us more convenient and comfortable functions in cloud side.
