=======
This is a basic website with the basic functions of sign-up and login and different pages within React router.
The auth solution of this website is AWS Cognito, so we do not need Backend anymore for fetch TokenID,auth sign-up or even a confirmation email from AWS.
Will continue with this project since AWS offers us more convenient and comfortable functions in cloud side.

Clone the repository and "npm install", for the user who is not familar with AWS, Maybe you need run"npm i amazon-cognito-identity-js"
Today is 25th of Nov, I med many issues with AWS account in US.
And we lost Diego Maradona (1960-2020)
